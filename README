                     repay - compute efficient repayments
                     ====================================

Repay is a simple tool which computes the most efficient way for everyone to
repay their debts.

You feed it a list of historical transactions (ie. a ledger):

    {"from":"Bill","to":"Fred","amt":7200}
    {"from":"Andy","to":"Alex","amt":7300}
    {"from":"Fred","to":"Mike","amt":7800}
    {"from":"Fred","to":"Mike","amt":4500}
    {"from":"Mike","to":"Alex","amt":5600}
    {"from":"Bill","to":"Fred","amt":9300}
    {"from":"Mike","to":"Andy","amt":6100}
    {"from":"Alex","to":"Bill","amt":2400}
    {"from":"Mike","to":"Bill","amt":6400}
    {"from":"Bill","to":"Andy","amt":9300}

And it spits out a minimal list of transactions which will make everyone
square:

    {"from":"Fred","to":"Mike","amt":4200}
    {"from":"Andy","to":"Bill","amt":8100}
    {"from":"Alex","to":"Mike","amt":1600}
    {"from":"Alex","to":"Bill","amt":8900}

As you can see, these transations are newline-delimited JSON objects.  The
input transactions may contain additional fields which repay will ignore:

    {"date":"2018-02-17","from":"Bill","to":"Fred","amt":7200,"reason":"Lunch"}
    {"date":"2018-02-19","from":"Andy","to":"Alex","amt":7300,"reason":"Bet on the football"}
    {"date":"2018-02-19","from":"Fred","to":"Mike","amt":7800,"reason":"Undisclosed"}

The output will still only contain "from", "to", and "amt", however.
